Greetings!

Appalachian Arts Studio is excited to announce the 2020 Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous. The event is being held in Ridgway, Pennsylvania the weekend of April 23 - 25, 2020. We would like to extend an opportunity to your company to market to a global audience by becoming a sponsor for this event.

The Rendezvous itself has grown over the years to host nearly 20,000 spectators annually. Originally founded to promote the art of chainsaw carving, the festival has grown beyond our expectations. Carvers will setup booth spaces to sell their finished pieces directly to the public and will be doing LIVE chainsaw carving. Additionally there will be vendors and an expanded line-up of musical entertainment.

Please feel free to contact me with questions or concerns.
Thank you in advance for your consideration! 


Sincerely,
Liz Boni
Appalachian Arts Studio
Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous Event Director
