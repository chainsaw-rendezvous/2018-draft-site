Carvers will be live carving in 2020! Each will start with an 8 foot log to create a finished piece. There will not be a public auction; many carvers will bring finished pieces to sell direct to the public. Payment methods depend on the carver, but most accept credit cards.

Are you a carver that wants to attend the Rendezvous? The [Carver Information page](../carver-info) is for you.
