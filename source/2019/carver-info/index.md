Dear Carvers,
It is with much excitement that I am writing this letter!
Recently the Rendezvous committee had a meeting with members of the town and, like you and the public, they would like to see more carving for 2019. That being said, we worked together to develop this year’s event. Here are some important things to know:
- The announced dates are the same! April 25-28
- The event will move from downtown to {% link Gillis Ave https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gillis+Ave,+Ridgway,+PA+15853/@41.4202531,-78.7409572,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89cd0165b5ec6b0b:0x18715399e3176859!8m2!3d41.4202491!4d-78.7387632 true%}.
- Previous Rendezvous have been held here, but the building has had many improvements made to it.
- There will be a 75 carver limit. The committee can accept or reject any application 
- We will have vendors, live music, and more for the public to enjoy
- Carvers will be able to camp on location or secure their own lodging

The first 75 carvers who apply, pay a $100 registration fee, and are accepted will get: 
- 10x20 space for carving and selling
- One 8 foot log to carve during the event
- T shirt

Carvers can keep or sell their piece from the event! It’s your log to do what you wish. There will be no auction.

There will be prize money for a couple categories. Details for how voting will happen for these categories will be announced.

Our grounds crew is limited; carvers will be responsible for their own carvings and sales. Including the loading and unloading of carvings. 

The Rendezvous is back!
