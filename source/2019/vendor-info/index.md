We are accepting a limited number of craft and food vendors to participate in the 2018 Rendezvous. There will be a fee associated with a booth space and must be reserved prior to the event. Details on setup will be provided to each vendor.

Contact Liz Boni at info@chainsawrendezvous.org to secure a spot.
