Greetings to the entire carving community,

We know the entire world is anxious to return to the normality that existed prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, we have decided not hold the Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous in 2021 because we do not have the resources to meet the requirements set forth by the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control for holding large events.

The Rendezvous draws carvers and admirers from all over Pennsylvania, the United States, and internationally which increases the likelihood of people travelling with the virus and exposing others. With appropriate mitigation and increased immunizations, we look forward to welcoming everyone back to Ridgway next year.

We hope you will support the work of carvers who have attended in the past by visiting their workshop, website and social media. There's a list of cavers available for [2018](/2018/carvers) and [2019](/2019/carvers).

For additional information about this virus, including symptoms, how it is spread, who is vulnerable, how to protect yourself, current treatment recommendations, and vaccine information visit the CDC website directly at [cdc.gov](https://cdc.gov)
