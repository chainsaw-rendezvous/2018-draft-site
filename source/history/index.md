Brothers Rick & Randy Boni are responsible for the idea of the Chainsaw Carverâ€™s Rendezvous. With the help of their wives, the brothers decided to gather a few friends and family members with the intention of carving designs and figures into wood with chainsaws. The event was small and simple, but would set the stage for this annual event.
