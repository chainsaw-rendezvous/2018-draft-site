    <p class="uk-text-lead">Read about the cancelation of the 2020 Rendezvous in response to the current Coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
    <p class="uk-article-meta">Posted March 16, 2020</p>

    <p>Regarding the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: Despite there being no reported cases in Elk County, as of March 16, we have decided, out of an abundance of caution, to follow the advice of the CDC and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and cancel the 2020 Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous. We are as saddened as you that for the first time in 21 years the buzz of chainsaws wonâ€™t be heard in Ridgway this Spring.</p>

    <p>We know that the carvers, public, and local businesses look forward to this event each year just as much as we look forward to planning it. However, because the Rendezvous draws people from all across the United States and internationally, the event has an increased likelihood of contributing to the virus spreading.</p>

    <p>We are exploring options to reschedule the Rendezvous for later in the year and will keep carvers and the public informed at <a href="https://chainsawrendezvous.org">chainsawrendezvous.org</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/chainsawrendezvous">facebook.com/chainsawrendezvous</a></p>
 
    <p>For additional information about this virus, including symptoms, how it is spread, who is vulnerable, how to protect yourself, and current treatment recommendations visit the CDC website directly at <a href="https://cdc.gov">cdc.gov</a></p>

<p>Throughout the Rendezvous there will be opportunities to interact with skilled artists, enjoy live music, and purchase finished pieces directly from the artist.</p>
<p><span class="uk-text-bold uk-text-large">Come out to watch the live carving!</span> That's right, each carver will start with an 8 foot log to chop away at and shape into a finished piece. If you like what you see, make the carver an offer to take it home with you.</p>
<p>Carvers will be competing for awards in three categories: People's Choice, Social Media Choice, and Carver's Choice.</p>
<p><s>We hope you will Rendezvous with us <span class="uk-text-bold uk-text-uppercase uk-text-large">April 23-25, 2020</span> in Ridgway!</s></p>
