<p>Throughout the Rendezvous there will be opportunities to interact with skilled artists, enjoy live music, and purchase finished pieces directly from the artist.</p>
<p><span class="uk-text-bold uk-text-large">Come out to watch the live carving!</span> That's right, each carver will start with an 8 foot log to chop away at and shape into a finished piece. If you like what you see, make the carver an offer to take it home with you.</p>
<p>Carvers will be competing for awards in three categories: People's Choice, Social Media Choice, and Carver's Choice.</p>
