Welcome back to Ridgway for the 2022 Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous. Appalachian Arts Studio will be hosting 75 carvers at The Ridgway Mills, April 27-30 for live carving, food, entertainment, and a small auction. Many carvers will bring finished pieces with them to sell directly. April is going to be perfect weather for the event and you don't want to miss it.
