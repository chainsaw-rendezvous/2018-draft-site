Welcome back to Ridgway for the 2022 Chainsaw Carvers Rendezvous. Appalachian Arts Studio will be hosting 75 carvers at The Ridgway Mills, April 27-30 for live carving, food, entertainment, and a small auction. Many carvers will bring finished pieces with them to sell directly. April is going to be perfect weather for the event and you don't want to miss it.
Be sure to add your email address to the mailing list for updates and watch on our Facebook page.
