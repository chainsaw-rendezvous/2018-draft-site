Carvers will be live carving in 2025! Each will start with an 8 foot log to create a piece. Many carvers will bring finished pieces to sell direct to the public and there will be a small auction after the Saturday quick carve.

<strong>Are you a carver that wants to attend the Rendezvous?</strong> The [Carver Information page](../carver-info) is for you. Or go directly to the [registration form](https://register.chainsawrendezvous.org/carvers).
